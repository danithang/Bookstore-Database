# Bookstore-Database
A mock database I made in school for a local bookstore 

This is an assignment from a class I took called IT-330 Database Design and Management.  I created the database on November 8, 2015.  I recommended a database storage system for a local bookstore whom only relied on Microsoft Excel to keep track of customer information, product information, order details, payment, and employee information.  The bookstore wanted to expand by opening other stores as well as have an online store.  I designed and created a database for the local bookstore using Microsoft Visio to create diagrams and Microsoft SQL Server to code a working database.
